## Meals

* Breakfast and lunch will be provided each day through the meal cards that will be given to you when you check in to the dorms. 
* Your meal card is programmed with the prearranged All-You-Care-to-Eat meals, which can be used at Local Point dining hall. Please note that this is the only dining location on campus that the card will work for. 
* Breakfast is available in the Local Point dining facility from 7:30am – 10am and lunch is available from 11am – 2:30pm.
* If you are staying at a hotel or commuting, you will receive a meal card when you check in at the welcome table on the first day at the Maple Hall Great Room.  

## Travel

* Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offers a range of connections to the University of Washington Campus.
* The Link light rail is an easy, great way to get to the UW campus from the airport. It picks you up at the airport, comes about every 5-15 minutes, and drops you off right on the UW campus; just a 15-minute walk from the dorms you will be staying in.
* From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The cost is $3.00 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the northbound train toward Northgate to the University of Washington station (Note: do not get off at the University Street Station!). 
* Taxis and uber/lyft are also available from the airport. Note that for uber/lyft you will meet the car in the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.
