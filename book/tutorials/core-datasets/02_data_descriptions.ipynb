This is preliminary because we are still adjusting and correcting some of the spatial data after confirming locations and sampling designs with site leads. The Snow Class column was extracted from the 300 m Snow Classification data set (Liston, 2021 and can be accessed [here](https://nsidc.org/data/NSIDC-0768/versions/1) at NSIDC). See the previous notebook to characterize the Snow Classes. This table does not include about ~50 snow pits that were part of the 2021 TS campaign from the Fraser Experiemental Forest becuase of the modified spatial sampling design, but will be included in the published data set, and the table will be updated to reflect those additional snow pits. \n",
