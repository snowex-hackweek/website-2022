    "\n",
    "[UAVSAR](https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/education/what-is-uavsar.html) is a low frequency plane-based synthetic aperature radar. UAVSAR stands for \"Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperature Radar\". It captures imagery using a L-band radar. This low frequency means it can penetrate into and through clouds, vegetation, and snow.\n",

    "## Why would I use UAVSAR?\n",
    "\n",
    "UAVSAR works with low frequency radar waves. These low frequencies (< 3 GHz) can penetrate clouds and maintain coherence (a measure of radar image quality) over long periods. For these reasons, time series was captured over 13 sites as part of the winter of 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 for snow applications. Additionally the UAVSAR is awesome!"

It nativiely downloads, formats, and converts this data in analysis ready rasters projected in WSG-84 Lat/Lon ([EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326). The data traditionally comes in a binary format, which is not injestible by traditional geospatial analysis software (Python, R, QGIS, ArcGIS).

If you need to register for a NASA earthdata account use this [link](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/). A netrc file is a hidden file, it won't appear in the your file explorer, that is in your home directory and that programs can access to get the appropriate usernames and passwords. While you'll have already done this for the Hackweek virtual machines, ```uavsar_pytools``` has a tool to create this netrc file on a local computer. You only need to create this file once and then it should be permanently stored on your computer."
