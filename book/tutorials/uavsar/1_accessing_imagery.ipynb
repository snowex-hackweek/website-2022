    "\n",
    "[UAVSAR](https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/education/what-is-uavsar.html) is a low frequency plane-based synthetic aperature radar. UAVSAR stands for \"Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperature Radar\". It captures imagery using a L-band radar. This low frequency means it can penetrate into and through clouds, vegetation, and snow.\n",

It nativiely downloads, formats, and converts this data in analysis ready rasters projected in WSG-84 Lat/Lon (maybe more information here). The data traditionally comes in a binary format, which is not injestible by traditional geospatial analysis software (Python, R, QGIS, ArcGIS).

If you need to register for a NASA earthdata account use this [link](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/). A netrc file is a hidden file, it won't appear in the your file explorer, that is in your home directory and that programs can access to get the appropriate usernames and passwords. While you won't need to use this for this demonstration uavsar_pytools has a tool to create this netrc file on a local computer.
