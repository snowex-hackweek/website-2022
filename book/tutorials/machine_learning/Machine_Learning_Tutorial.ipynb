    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning simply means building algorithms or computer models using data. The goal is to use these \"trained\" computer models to make decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a general definition;\n",
    "\n",
    "> Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel, 1959)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, ML algorithms have achieved great success in a wide variety of fields. Its success stories include disease diagnostics, image recognition, self-driving cars, spam detectors, and handwritten digit recognition. In this tutorial we will train a model using a SnowEx dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to build a computer model that returns 1 if the input is a prime number and 0 otherwise. This model may be represented as follows;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = F(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $X \\to$ the number entered also called a feature\n",
    "   * $Y \\to$ the outcome we want to predict\n",
    "   * $F \\to$ the model that gets the job done\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to classical programming where we the program function, in Machine Learning we learn the function by training the algorithm with data. \n",

    "Machine learning algorithms can be categorized based on different criteria. In this tutorial, our categorization will be based on the amount and type of supervision needed during the training process. Based on this criterion, there are four major categories; supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We shall limit our definition to the first two;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning**: this refers to tasks where we have a specific outcome to predict. That is, every observation of the features has a corresponding outcome. An example of a supervised learning task is predicting snow depth based on some influencing features.\n",
    "\t \n",
    "* **Unsupervised Learning**: this refers to tasks where we have no outcome to predict.  Here, rather than predict an outcome, we seek to understand the relationship between the features or between the observations or to detect anomalous observations. Considering the example above, we assume the snow depth variable does not exist and we either understand the relationship between the features or between the observations based on the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that a variable can either be categorical or continuous. For now, let's focus on the nature of the outcome variable. In *Supervised Learning* parlance, if the outcome variable is categorical, we have a *classification* task and if continuous, we are in the presence of a *regression* task. Categorical implies that the variable is made of distinct categories (e.g. hair color: grey, blonde, black) and continuous implies that the variable is measured (e.g. snow depth). For the rest of this tutorial, we will focus on *Supervised Learning* tasks with a special concentration on regression tasks.\n",

    "1. TensorFlow\n",
    "2. Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensorflow**: it is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It makes it easy to train and deploy machine learning models. TensorFlow was created at Google and supports many of their large-scale Machine Learning applications. Read more at [About TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keras:**  Keras is a deep learning Application Programming Interface (API) written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Read more at [About Keras](https://keras.io/about/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other packages needed come pre-installed in Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to install TensorFlow as Keras comes as a submodule in TensorFlow. To install TensorFlow, launch the **Jupyter Lab Terminal** and type the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  $\\texttt{C:\\Users\\Default> pip install tensorflow}$\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you will be able to continue with the tutorial. For this tutorial, both Tensorflow and Keras used are version 2.8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Machine Learning techniques can be characterised as either *parametric* or *non-parametric*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Parametric:** The parametric approach simplifies the problem of estimating $F$ to a parameter estimation problem. The disadvantage is that we assume a particular shape of $F$ that may not match the true shape of $F$. The major advantage of using parametric approach that when inference is the goal we can understand how changing $X_1, X_2, \\cdots, X_k$ effects $Y$. A common parametric method is the Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-parametric:** Non-parametric approaches do not assume any shape for $F$. Instead, they try to estimate $F$ that gets as close to the data points as possible. The disadvantage of non-parametric approaches is that they require extensive training observations to estimate $F$ accurately. Common examples of non-parametric methods include Random Forest, Neural Networks, and support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on non-parametric approaches with a specific concentration on Random Forest and Neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is a simple but powerful algorithm that handles classification and regression tasks. The structural building blocks of Random Forest are decision trees; we will begin our explanation with decision trees. When we use decision trees for regression tasks, we call them regression trees; when we use decision trees for classification tasks, we call them classification trees. Subsequently, we use “regression trees” instead of “decision trees” because we will solve a regression problem in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset $\\mathcal{D}_n = \\left\\lbrace (\\textbf{x}_1, y_1), (\\textbf{x}_2, y_2), \\cdots, (\\textbf{x}_n, y_n) \\right\\rbrace$ where $\\textbf{x}_i^\\top \\equiv ({x}_{i1}, {x}_{i2}, \\cdots, {x}_{ik})$ denotes the $k$-dimensional vector of features, and $y_i$ represents the corresponding outcome (continuous in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental concept underlying regression trees is to split the feature space (set of possible values for the features) into two sub-regions. The sub-regions are further divided into two until a stopping criterion is reached. The predicted value of a given observation is the arithmetic mean of the training observations in the region it belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we estimate the true outcome ($Y$) using a trained ML algorithm ($F(X)$), the discrepancy between the observed and predicted must be quantified. The question is, how do we quantify this discrepancy? This brings the notion of **loss function**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Loss Function* $\\mathcal{L} (\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a bivariate function that quantifies the loss (error) we sustain from predicting $Y$ with $F(X)$. Put another way, **loss function** quantifies how close the prediction $F(X)$ is to the ground truth $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists quite a number of ways for which the loss of a regression problem may be quantified. We now illustrate two of them;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} (Y,F(X)) = (Y - F(X))^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is popularly known as the *squared error loss* and it is simply the square of the difference between the observed and the predicted values. The loss is squared so that the function reaches its minimum (convex).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} (Y,F(X)) = |Y - F(X)|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to quantify regression loss is by taking the absolute value of the difference between the observed ($Y$) and the predicted ($F(X)$) values. This is called the L1 loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that the *loss function* as defined above corresponds to a single observation. However, in practice, we want to quantify the loss over the entire dataset and this is where the notion of **empirical risk** comes in. Loss quantified over the entire dataset is called the *empirical risk*. Our goal in ML is to develop an algorithm such that the *empirical risk* is as minimum as possible. *Empirical risk* is also called the *cost function* or the *objective function* we want to minimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression Empirical Risk\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical risk corresponding to the squared error loss is called \"mean squared error\", while the empirical risk corresponding to the L1 loss is called \"mean absolute error\". Other Regression Loss functions can be found at [Keras: losses](https://keras.io/api/losses/)"

    "Regression trees suffer from high variance, that is, they have a habit of overfitting the training observations. A straightforward way to reduce the variance is to employ the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. RF is an ensemble learning technique that can be used for both classification and regression. The term “ensemble learning” means combining multiple algorithms to obtain an improved version of the constituting algorithms. RF does this using the concept of Bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bagging:** Bagging consists of two words; Bootstrap and Aggregation. Bootstrap is a popular resampling technique where random sub-samples (with replacement) are created from the training data. The individual bootstrapped sub-sample is called a “Bag.” Aggregation, however, means combining the results from machines trained on the respective bags. We could say, given our training data, we generate $B$ bootstrapped training sub-samples from the original training data, then we train an algorithm on the respective bootstrapped sub-sample to obtain $\\hat{F}^1 (\\text{x}), \\hat{F}^2 (\\text{x}), \\cdots , \\hat{F}^B (\\text{x})$. The final predicted value is the average of all the individual predictions and it is given by:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{F}_{\\text{bag}} (\\text{x}) = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b = 1}^{B} \\hat{F}^{b} (\\text{x}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is bagging! In the RF algorithm, regression trees are built on the different bootstrapped samples and the result is a forest of regression trees, hence the \"forest\" in Random Forest. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What makes the forest random?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when training a regression tree, splitting is done at each internal node, however, in the RF algorithm, when building the individual regression trees, only a random sample of the total features is considered for optimal splitting and this is what makes the forest random! In essence, when we combine bagging with random feature selection at each internal node of the constituting regression trees, we are said to have constructed a **Random Forest** learning machine."

    "Each layer in a NN consists of small individual units called neurons (usually represented with a circle). A neuron receives inputs from other neurons, performs some mathematical operations, and then produces an output. Each neuron in the input layer represents a  feature. In essence, the number of neurons in the input layer equals the number of features. Each neuron in the input layer is connected to every neuron in the hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is not fixed, it is problem dependent and it is often determined via cross-validation or validation set approach in practice. \n",

A NN with more than one hidden layer is called a **deep neural network** while that with a single hidden layer is a **shallow neural network**. The final layer of a neural network is called the output layer and it holds the predicted outcomes of observations passed into the input layer. Every inter-neuron connection has an associated weight, these weights are what the neural network learns during the training process. When connections between the layers do not form a loop, such networks are called **feedforward neural networks** and if otherwise, they are called **recurrent neural networks**.
