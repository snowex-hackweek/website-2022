# Lidar Remote Sensing

```{admonition} Learning Objectives
In this tutorial, we will learn how to work with lidar derived raster product that represent topography and snow depth. The objectives include:
1. Understanding the basic concept of lidar remote sensing
2. Deriving snow products from lidar DEMs differencing
3. Analyzing lidar raster data
4. Identifying available lidar data for snow science
```

```{important}
The prerequisite for this tutorial is basic experience with python and geospatial data. 
```
## Overview

We will start by exploring point cloud data and take a quick look at how rasters are created from them. Then we will derive vegetation and snow depth by differencing elevation models followed by analysing these lidar data including DEM. Finally, we will address common issue with working with lidar data from varying sources and talk about available snow focused lidar data.
